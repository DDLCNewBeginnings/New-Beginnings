##### What is the Dating feature like?

Just like a vanilla light novel, you are finally able to ask girls out on dates, where you can choose when and where! If you take a girl to her favorite restaurant, for example, she will gain interest in you and possibly further her route. 

##### Why did my anti-virus software delete one or more files of the game?

Like most of the fan-made DDLC mods, certain scripts used in the game's coding can trigger sensitive antivirus softwares.
