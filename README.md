# New Beginnings(NB)
New Beginnings is a mod for Doki Doki Literature club [Doki Doki Literature Club](https://www.ddlc.moe) from [Team Salvato](http://teamsalvato.com/) NB replaces the original game with an alternate storyline with new characters, backgrounds, music, and game mechanics!

# Story

After a car accident that took the lives of both your parents, you return to your hometown after being separated from your sister. Now, after three entire years of working at your uncle's furniture shop, you reunite with your childhood best friend, Sayori, as she introduces you to a new school, where you meet many new friends. How will you forge your last year of high school?

## Features

* All new individualized dating system! Take the girls out on special dates - you pick when and where!

* Weekends are you fun days! You can choose to call your friends, go out for a walk at the park, or if you have the confidence, ask someone out!

* All new backgrounds, character graphics, music, and more! We're packing three times the content as the original game!
