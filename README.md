# New-Beginnings(NB)
New Beginnings is a mod for Doki Doki Literature club [Doki Doki Literature Club](https://www.ddlc.moe) from [Team Salvato](http://teamsalvato.com/) NB replaces the original game with an alternate storyline with new characters, backgrounds, music, and game mechanics!

# Story

After a car accident that took the lives of both your parents, you return to your hometown after being separated from your sister. Now, after three entire years of working at your uncle's furniture shop, you reunite with your childhood best friend, Sayori, as she introduces you to a new school, where you meet many new friends. How will you forge your last year of high school?

## Features

* 4+ Endings! Now, Monika has her very own route! 

* New game mechanics, like the "Dating" feature, where you can take your special girl out! Choose when and where!

* New artwork, backgrounds, music, characters, and more!

### Getting Involved

As this is a huge overhaul to the game, we are requesting your help! We're currently seeking artists who can design backgrounds and characters! In the future, a Discord server will be available to join to discuss the mod, as well as getting involved with its community.
